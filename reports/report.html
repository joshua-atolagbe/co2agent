        <h1>CO₂ Storage Assessment Report: Well 15/9-14, Sleipner Field, Norway</h1>

        <h2>Technical Report on CO₂ Storage Potential in the Utsira and Ekofisk Formations</h2>
    </div>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of the CO₂ storage potential in the Utsira and Ekofisk Formations, located within the Sleipner Field in the Norwegian North Sea. The assessment synthesizes insights from petrophysical analyses, core sample evaluations, and structural geological assessments.</p>
    <p>The Utsira Formation demonstrates superior characteristics for CO₂ sequestration, featuring high effective porosity (average 0.37), well-sorted sands, and robust reservoir integrity. In contrast, the Ekofisk Formation, while possessing lower porosity (ranging from 0.10 to 0.18) and variable permeability, still shows significant potential for CO₂ storage, albeit with greater challenges related to fluid management and reservoir integrity.</p>
    <p>Both formations are underlain by stable geological structures, with the Utsira Formation exhibiting a more favorable fault configuration compared to the Ekofisk. The caprock characteristics of both formations suggest a high level of containment, with minor risks associated with faulting observed predominantly in the Ekofisk Formation.</p>
    <p>Recommendations for further monitoring and evaluation are provided to optimize CO₂ injection strategies and assess the long-term behavior of injected CO₂ in relation to reservoir dynamics.</p>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This technical report synthesizes the analyses conducted by petrophysicists, core analysts, and structural geologists (agents) regarding the CO₂ storage potential in the Utsira and Ekofisk Formations. The evaluation encompasses petrophysical properties, core sample characteristics, and structural features that influence the reservoirs' capabilities for carbon dioxide sequestration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h2>2. Identified Reservoirs</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Utsira Formation</h3>
        It is situated above the Utsira water layer and below the shallow gas zone, extending from 1740 to 1950 meters with an average thickness of 210 meters.
        <h4>2.1.1 Petrophysical Properties</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> The Utsira Formation exhibits a high average effective porosity of 0.37, with a range from 0.35 to 0.39. This significant capacity for fluid storage is crucial for CO₂ sequestration, as higher porosity allows for greater accommodation of injected gases.</li>
            <li><strong>Permeability:</strong> While specific permeability values were not provided in the initial analysis, the formation is characterized by fine to medium-grained, well-sorted sands. Such characteristics typically indicate high permeability, which is conducive to fluid flow and essential for efficient CO₂ injection and migration.</li>
            <li><strong>Grain Size and Sorting:</strong> The sands within the Utsira Formation are predominantly fine to medium-grained, composed of clear to translucent quartz. The grains are described as sub-rounded to well-rounded, exhibiting good to excellent sorting. These attributes enhance the reservoir's ability to transmit fluids, making it more favorable for CO₂ storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Mineralogy:</strong> The primary mineralogy of the Utsira sands consists mainly of quartz, with traces of mica, pyrite, and kaolinite. The presence of quartz, particularly in a well-sorted and relatively uncemented state, is advantageous for reservoir performance, as it contributes to both permeability and stability under reservoir conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluid Saturation:</strong> The formation is saturated with seawater, which is a key consideration for CO₂ injection. The pre-existing water saturation influences the buoyancy and migration of injected CO₂, facilitating its effective placement within the reservoir.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h4>2.1.2 Structural Characteristics</h4>
        <p>The Utsira Formation is characterized by a stable fault configuration, predominantly featuring reverse motion faults that do not significantly impact the upper reservoir sections or the caprock integrity. The formation is capped by the Nordland Shale, which serves as the primary seal, providing a robust barrier to fluid migration and enhancing the storage security of the reservoir.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h3>2.2 Ekofisk Formation</h3>
        <h4>2.2.1 Petrophysical Properties</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> The Ekofisk Formation displays a lower porosity range of 0.10 to 0.18 compared to the Utsira Formation. This reduced porosity may limit its fluid storage capacity relative to the Utsira sands, potentially impacting its effectiveness for CO₂ sequestration.</li>
            <li><strong>Permeability:</strong> Specific permeability values for the Ekofisk were not detailed. However, the presence of alternating hard limestones and softer claystones suggests variable permeability characteristics, which could influence fluid flow dynamics within the reservoir.</li>
            <li><strong>Grain Size and Sorting:</strong> The Ekofisk Formation is primarily composed of Cretaceous limestones with varying hardness, interspersed with claystones and marls. The grain size is generally fine to medium, with instances of coarser material. The overall sorting is moderate, which may affect the reservoir's permeability relative to more finely sorted formations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mineralogy:</strong> The dominant minerals in the Ekofisk Formation include limestone, claystone, and traces of silica. The limestones are noted for their hardness and potential for cementation, which can impact both permeability and the mechanical stability of the reservoir.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluid Saturation:</strong> This formation contains hydrocarbons, with a notable gas level of 0.4% for methane. The presence of hydrocarbons indicates an active petroleum system, which may enhance the reservoir's potential for hydrocarbon recovery but could complicate CO₂ injection strategies due to the need for managing pre-existing hydrocarbons.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h4>2.2.2 Structural Characteristics</h4>
        <p>The Ekofisk Formation features a less pronounced faulting pattern compared to the Utsira Formation, with primarily normal faults that may influence fluid dynamics to a lesser extent. The caprock consists of harder limestones and claystones, which exhibit variable permeability characteristics. While this caprock serves to contain injected gases, its integrity may be compromised due to the presence of normal faults, potentially creating pathways for fluid migration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h2>3. Potential Risks</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Wellbore Risks</h3>
        <p>Both formations present minimal wellbore risks, with stable geological structures observed in the Utsira Formation and a less pronounced faulting pattern in the Ekofisk Formation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h3>3.2 Leakage Risks</h3>
        <p>The Utsira Formation exhibits a high level of containment with a robust caprock, while the Ekofisk Formation may have moderate leakage risks associated with normal faults that could create pathways for fluid migration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-break">
        <h3>3.3 Injection Risks</h3>
        <p>The injection risks are considered low for both formations, with favorable reservoir characteristics supporting effective CO₂ injection.</p>
    </div>
